                <p>From time to time, products you order may be unavailable. If we
                    are unable to fulfill your entire order, we will make every reasonable effort to substitute the
                    closest product.
                    We do not set the prices for the items you select on your grocery list. We pay the prices that each
                    individual

                <p>To receive delivery, you do not need to be present to receive
                    your order from our driver. In the case of bad weather or unforeseen delivery complications,
                    deliveries may be
                    delayed. We will make every effort to get your groceries to you by 5:00 pm on the date of your
                    arrival.</p>
                <p>Your order will arrive with an invoice that will list all of the
                    items you have received and were billed for. If something is missing from your order, please call us
                    so that we
                    can do everything reasonable in our power to ensure your satisfaction. In the case where you fail to
                    pay for the
                    products ordered, you agree to forfeit to the Company any right, title, or interest you may have in
                    the
                    products.</p>
